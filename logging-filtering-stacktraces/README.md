This is an example of utilizing two specific useful features of Logback logging:
* Reverse exception logging
* Filtering out stackframes by package name from the stack trace

Consider the following stacktrace, in the common format generated by most logging frameworks:

```
ERROR - our message
java.lang.RuntimeException: error trying to get something done
	at com.example.app.Application.doSomething(Application.java:21)
	at com.example.app.Application.main(Application.java:11)
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: error message
	at com.example.util.Utils.doSomethingThatThrowsAnException(Utils:5)
	at com.example.app.Application.doSomething(Application.java:19)
	... 1 common frames omitted
```

The problem with this format is that, usually, the exception we most care about is the last "Caused by".
In most real-world applications, we commonly see stacktraces that are *much* longer than this.
And, thus, we spend way more time than necessary sifting through all the lines to find the real cause of the error.


Using Logback, we can reverse the order of the reported exceptions, so that the deepest appears first:

```
ERROR - our message
java.lang.IllegalStateException: error message
	at com.example.util.Utils.doSomethingThatThrowsAnException(Utils:5)
	at com.example.app.Application.doSomething(Application.java:19)
	... 1 common frames omitted
Wrapped by: java.lang.RuntimeException: error trying to get something done
	at com.example.app.Application.doSomething(Application.java:21)
	at com.example.app.Application.main(Application.java:11)
```

And by filtering out stack frames from package `com.example.app`, we get:

```
ERROR - our message
java.lang.IllegalStateException: error message
	at com.example.util.Utils.doSomethingThatThrowsAnException(Utils:5)
 [2 skipped]
	... 1 common frames omitted
Wrapped by: java.lang.RuntimeException: error trying to get something done
 [2 skipped]
```

Both of these are achieved by configuring the logging pattern in [the configuration file, logback.xml](src/main/resources/logback.xml)
Specifically, we are using the `%rEx` syntax in the pattern.  
The `r` reverses the order of the causes in the stacktrace, and the `Ex` excludes the packages listed.
